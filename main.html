Ensure you’re aware of any little things such as a deadlock that can only open from inside, a sticking door, or even an alarm system that might auto-trigger or need to be disarmed as you enter the house.</p>

                        <p class="bodyoftext2">All good pets deserve treats! Find out what commands the pet can follow and how to reward them. But you need to be prepared to deal if the pet misbehaves too - what does your client usually do? What do they think it is appropriate for you to do?</p>

                        <p class="bodyoftext"> Sometimes the only way you can really find this out is through experience. Some dogs might act differently if there’s a different person on the end of the lead, but you can try and be prepared. How do they deal with loud noises, other animals, and people, and do you need to avoid those if there’s issues? Does the pet walk well on or off a lead? Can you trust them to come to you in an off-leash area? </p>

                        <p class="bodyoftext">This information should be readily available to any pet sitter. Where is their local/preferred vet? I recommend having the vet’s number close at hand - as a note on the fridge, or programmed into your phone. Also - if the owner is going away for an extended period or will be out of contact range, it is very important to know what you need to do if the worst happens and you’re asked to make a choice to prevent an animal’s suffering. Sad to think about, but it can be a reality, so best to be prepared.</p>

                        <p class="bodyoftext">Playing is almost as important as food and water to a pet! They all have their own favourite things to do and ways to tell you what they want to do. Do they play rough or jump up when excited?
